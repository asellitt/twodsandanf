# Executive Summary #

Picture that you've just planned the perfect trip. Your GPS says take the next left....And
the road is out of service.

What we propose is a way for holiday goers, or tourists (or the average Joe) to plan an
optimum route from point a to point b taking these problems into consideration.

Users will manage these problems themselves, logging the problems, and updating their
status. They will also be able to discuss these issues. (Account holders only)

Traffic related news will also be available, and comments may be made there too.

Places of interest/tourists attractions will also have the ability to promote themselves and any route planned will also highlight these places at their destination.

Account holders will benefit from quick access to local problems (based on their home
location). Further, users will be able to chat with each other (forum-based) and be
notified of any messages placed on their logged problems.

A reputation system will be developed whereby users with a higher reputation may log
problems with very little verification required. Untrusted users will require more
verification before their logged problems become verified.
